Unlike other bike stands, which you need to lift the bike and put into. Our stand's front holder will tilt when you push the bike into the rack. This patented great design will be PERFECT for heavy bikes such as downhill, mountain and beach bikes.<br /> <br /> Most Stable Bike Stand<br /> There are three points holding on the tires, much better than other stands which have only one or two points holding on the frame, rim, disc rotor and derailleur. The bike's front or rear wheel sitting in the holder is much deeper than others, so it stays firmly in the holder. Plus a stylish dynamic stand base makes the bike impossible to be tilted if you do not push extremely hard onto the bike.<br /> <br /> Superb Durable Quality &amp; Stunning Finish to Match Your Bike<br /> Heat treated high quality steel with a fantastic powder coated finish. This stand will last forever if used appropriately. FITS NEARLY ALL BIKES: The bike stand will fit almost all bikes range from 26' to 29' Mountain Bikes, 650c -700c Road Bikes, EXCEPT those bikes with the tires more than 2.4' in width.</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>Mounting Bolt Included<br /> <br /> Order Now Worry Free!<br /> We're so confident about our product quality that we can provide a LIFETIME WARRANTY!<br /> <br /> Weight: 3.14kg = 6.92lbs<br /> Made in Taiwan<br /> Warranty: Life Time</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <div>&nbsp;</div>  <p style=""text-align: center;""><iframe allow=""autoplay; encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen="" frameborder=""0"" height=""350"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/zShHS-gTfy0"" width=""550""></iframe></p> "
